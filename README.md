# Energy Grabber by Ted - EGT
This is a custom plugin i have created for fetching the monthly energy cost from the internet. the entire thing is based on the site 'https://www.tsig.gr/' and it fetches the price from there. All you have to do is select your program and then copy the url in the configuration.yaml
